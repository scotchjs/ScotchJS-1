# ScotchJS-1

Planning for the first ever scotch js.. hopefully! 

# Premise

## Like a lan-party with drinks and code.

An 18+, Drinks and JS focused event.

Drinking optional but very un-frowned-upon.

Two full days (sat and sun)

Brisbane CBD (or close) location.

Fast internet

Lightly catered.

No organised talks/workshops

Ad-hoc group sessions on whatever arrises.

No significant lodgings, probably a good idea to stay in a hotel for two nights or whatever. We may be able to sleeping-bag on the floor of the venue.

Maybe shirts, depends on money and interest.
